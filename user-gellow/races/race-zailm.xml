			<p class="flavor">“My work may not yet be complete, but these creatures show just how grandiose my purpose is. After years of work, I’ve finally made substancial progress when it comes to using the power of souls. The men and women that were part of my latest test, of trying to power a dead body with only the power of a soul, have been reanimated as something more than they were before. While they still don’t seem to have memories of their previous life, they have become stronger, some have become faster and more resilient. Nothing less than a complete success.”</p>
				<p class="indent">- Y. Mageshell, Manyhals of Death</p>
				<p class="indent">The Zailm are reborn warriors who can’t get a grasp of their past. Originating from Zeiloryn, these once mortal humanoids scattered throughout Faleria in seach of themselves. While their past may be lost to them, their future is full of potencial due to their mind being null of previous abilities and their new enhanced physiology.</p>
			
			 <h4>IMORTALIZED MORTALS</h4>
				<p class="indent">Zailm don’t all hail from a shared mortal type. There are those who seem to have been human, others who are of a smaller stature and resemble halflings or gnomes and even those who tower over the tallest of mortals. Their state of decay is irrelevant to their functionallity, so it’s possible to see some Zailm who are missing limbs, jaws or much more of their bodies, while others are in pristine condition, only being recognised as Zailm due to their shared grayish skin tone.</p>
				<p class="indent">Despite this military power, it is far more common for Vlandaer to be on the defensive rather than on the attack as they only sought refuge from a world that didn’t accept them. Something that may be bound to change.</p>
			

			<h4>GALITARKO TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Galitarkos seem to be born with an assortment of abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong>Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong>Galitarkos reach adulthood at around 9 years old and live about 50 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>Galitarkos stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and average about 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong>Your claws are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mauling Strike.</em></strong>Immediately after you move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your claws as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bearable.</em></strong>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mortal subtype.</em></strong>Three main subtypes of galitarko populate Faleria: Grizzly, Panda and Polar Galitarko. Choose one of these subtypes.</p>

			<p> The grizzly galitarko wear a resemblance to either black, brown or grey bears. Natural of Manyhal and western Zeiloryn, these huge mortals can produce a fierce roar, 
			unlike any other. Though they might seem brutish, many carry the philosophy of Lendo, 
			that teaches you to always try to work for the greater good. In the case of the galitarko on the western side of Zeiloryn, 
			that meant joining the empire and it’s conquest. Grizzly galitarko often have only one name derived from an adjective given while they were young, such as Fasten, Hungrial, Madden and Swiffy.</p>
